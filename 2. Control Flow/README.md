# Control Flow in Python

This folder introduces the concept of control flow in Python, enabling you to control the execution of your code based on conditions and loops. These topics are crucial for writing dynamic and flexible programs.

## Files and Topics Covered

### 1. `05_if_else_statements.py`
- Understand conditional statements.
- Learn to use `if`, `elif`, and `else` for decision-making.
- Includes nested `if` examples.

### 2. `06_loops.py`
- Master iterative statements in Python:
  - `for` loops for definite iteration.
  - `while` loops for indefinite iteration.
- Learn about loop controls like `break`, `continue`, and `else`.

## How to Run the Code
1. Navigate to the `control_flow` folder:
   ```bash
   cd control_flow
   ```
2. Run any file using Python:
   ```bash
   python <file_name.py>
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   python 05_if_else_statements.py
   ```

## Learning Objectives
- Implement decision-making in Python programs.
- Use loops to repeat tasks efficiently.
- Understand when and how to exit loops or skip iterations.

Practice these concepts thoroughly as they are foundational for problem-solving in Python. 

Happy coding!
