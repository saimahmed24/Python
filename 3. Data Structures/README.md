# Data Structures in Python

This folder introduces the core data structures in Python, such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. Each file demonstrates the use cases, basic operations, and unique features of these structures.

## Files and Topics Covered

### 1. `07_lists.py`
- Learn about lists, one of the most versatile data structures in Python.
- Topics covered:
  - Adding and removing elements.
  - Accessing and slicing elements.
  - Iterating through a list.

### 2. `08_tuples.py`
- Understand tuples, an immutable sequence type.
- Topics covered:
  - Accessing elements.
  - Immutability and its importance.
  - Using tuples for multiple assignment.

### 3. `09_dictionaries.py`
- Dive into dictionaries, which store data as key-value pairs.
- Topics covered:
  - Adding, updating, and removing key-value pairs.
  - Accessing values safely using `get`.
  - Iterating through keys and values.

### 4. `10_sets.py`
- Explore sets, a collection of unique elements.
- Topics covered:
  - Adding and removing elements.
  - Performing set operations like union, intersection, and difference.
  - Checking membership.

## How to Run the Code
1. Navigate to the `data_structures` folder:
   ```bash
   cd data_structures
   ```
2. Run any file using Python:
   ```bash
   python <file_name.py>
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   python 07_lists.py
   ```

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the strengths and limitations of different data structures.
- Choose the right data structure for your specific use case.
- Practice basic and advanced operations to manipulate data effectively.
