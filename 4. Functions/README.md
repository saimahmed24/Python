# Functions in Python

This folder explores Python functions, an essential tool for creating reusable and modular code. The section covers a wide range of topics, from basic function definitions to advanced functional programming concepts.

## Files and Topics Covered

### 1. `11_defining_functions.py`
- Learn how to define and call functions in Python.
- Topics covered:
  - Basic function definitions.
  - Functions with parameters.
  - Using `return` to produce output.

### 2. `12_function_arguments.py`
- Understand function arguments and their flexibility.
- Topics covered:
  - Positional and keyword arguments.
  - Default arguments.
  - Passing arguments by name.

### 3. `13_return_values.py`
- Explore how to return values from functions.
- Topics covered:
  - Returning a single value.
  - Returning multiple values as tuples.

### 4. `14_lambda_functions.py`
- Get introduced to anonymous functions, also known as lambdas.
- Topics covered:
  - Writing and using lambda functions.
  - Using lambdas with `filter`, `map`, and `reduce`.

### 5. `15_scope_and_lifetime.py`
- Understand the scope and lifetime of variables in Python.
- Topics covered:
  - Local and global variables.
  - Using the `global` keyword.
  - Variable lifetime in different scopes.

### 6. `16_higher_order_functions.py`
- Dive into higher-order functions, which take other functions as arguments or return them.
- Topics covered:
  - Writing higher-order functions.
  - Using `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` for functional programming.

## How to Run the Code
1. Navigate to the `functions` folder:
   ```bash
   cd functions
   ```
2. Run any file using Python:
   ```bash
   python <file_name.py>
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   python 11_defining_functions.py
   ```

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to define and use functions effectively.
- Learn to use functional programming concepts like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.
- Gain clarity on variable scope and lifetime in Python.
